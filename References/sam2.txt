New Features:
üìÅ Folder Processing:

load_and_process_folder() - Processes all pcap files in a directory
Supports .pcap, .pcapng, and .cap file extensions
Automatically combines data from multiple files

üîß Flexible Usage Options:
python# Option 1: Process entire folder
features, labels = classifier.load_and_process_folder("./pcap_files")

# Option 2: Limit number of files (for testing)
features, labels = classifier.load_and_process_folder("./pcap_files", file_limit=5)

# Option 3: Single file processing still available
features, labels = classifier.load_and_process_pcap("./pcap_files/specific_file.pcap")
üìä Utility Functions:

list_pcap_files() - Lists all pcap files in a folder
get_file_info() - Shows file sizes and counts

How to Use:

Set your folder path:

pythonpcap_folder = "./pcap_files"  # Your folder path
# Examples:
# pcap_folder = "/home/user/network_data"  # Linux
# pcap_folder = r"C:\NetworkCaptures"     # Windows

Place your files:

Put all your .pcap and .pcapng files in the specified folder
The script will automatically find and process all supported files


Run the analysis:

The script processes all files, combines the data, and trains the model
Progress is shown for each file being processed



Benefits:

Batch Processing: Handle multiple capture files at once
Better Training Data: More diverse packets from multiple captures
Error Handling: Skips problematic files and continues processing
Progress Tracking: Shows which files are being processed
Memory Efficient: Processes files sequentially

Just update the pcap_folder variable to point to your directory containing the pcap files, and the script will handle the rest!RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.

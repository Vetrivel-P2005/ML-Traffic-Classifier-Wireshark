Key Features:
Feature Extraction:

Packet length, IP header fields (TTL, flags, protocol)
Port numbers (source/destination)
Protocol-specific features (TCP flags, window size, UDP length)
Binary indicators for protocol types

Classification Categories:

Web traffic (HTTP/HTTPS)
Email protocols
DNS queries
Database connections
Remote access (SSH/Telnet)
File transfer (FTP)
Network management (SNMP, DHCP, NTP)
ICMP traffic
Other TCP/UDP traffic

Machine Learning Pipeline:

Random Forest classifier for robust performance
Feature scaling and label encoding
Train/test split with stratification
Comprehensive evaluation metrics

How to Use:

Install Dependencies:

bashpip install scapy scikit-learn pandas matplotlib seaborn

Export Data from Wireshark:

Open your network capture in Wireshark
Go to File → Export → Save as pcap/pcapng format


Run Classification:

Update the pcap_file variable with your file path
Run the script to train and evaluate the model



Model Capabilities:

Automatic feature extraction from raw packet data
Multi-class classification with confidence scores
Feature importance analysis to understand key indicators
Visualization of results and model performance
Real-time prediction for new packets

The model automatically handles different protocol types and extracts relevant features for each. It's designed to be extensible - you can easily add new classification categories or features based on your specific network analysis needs.
